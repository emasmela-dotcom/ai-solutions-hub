## Introduction

If you've been shopping for a website, you've probably seen prices ranging from $1,000 to $15,000+ for a professional site. But what if we told you that AI-powered websites can deliver the same quality results at a fraction of the cost?

At AI Solutions Hub, we're revolutionizing website development by leveraging AI technology to build professional websites starting at just $949. Here's why AI-powered websites cost less and deliver better results.

## The Traditional Website Development Process

Traditional website development involves:
- **Manual coding** - Developers write every line of code
- **Content creation** - Writers create all content from scratch
- **Design work** - Designers create mockups and iterate
- **Multiple revisions** - Back-and-forth between client and developer
- **Time-intensive** - Projects can take weeks or months

All of this adds up to higher costs, typically $3,000-$8,000 for a basic 3-5 page website.

## How AI Changes the Game
